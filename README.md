userslist app


Hey! and welcome to my users-list App. It' a react native ( Using React native CLI ) project which uses the randomuser API to get users data and.
And Displays that data in the app. You can modify the users locally and add new users to the list.

Some of the libraries that I've used in the app are:

- Redux / Reduxtoolkit.
- React Query.
- Styled Components.
- Native Base.


## Getting Started

To start the app, you need to locally close this repo to your computer and than either run:

```

```
